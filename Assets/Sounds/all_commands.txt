- code for arduino/attami:
	VirtualWire\ArduinoCode\receiverand_neo2
	VirtualWire\ArduinoCode\VWtransmitter2	
- see python code (self explanatory) for the sequence of commands, or just play it into attami:
	VirtualWire\pythonCode\send_serial_to_arduino.py
- you'll have to cut the commands to single files, just make sure to leave a few samples before and after, otherwise it sometimes misses
- commands are 4 bytes for 'on' (id + 3 rgb values), and 5 for 'fade' (id + 5 rgb + fade time)
- the wav file will work on phone, for pc you have to invert it (take minus the signal)
